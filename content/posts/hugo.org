To run server:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ hugo server

Use the ~-D~ flag if you want to compile draft files too.
* Other things
- Taxonomies are like tag mechanisms. I don't need to use them (yet).
- ~_index.org~ in the main ~content/~ directory is used to render the homepage. In general, an ~_index.org~ file in ~content/PATH/~ is used to render the list page of ~PATH~.
- All layouts inherit from ~layouts/_default/baseof.html~.
- Everything under the static folder gets copied as-is to the root of the site.
